# osu!trigen [REWRITE]
## development info
we're currently developing the rewrite on 2022.1.0b1. to build, it should be as easy as cloning the repo and opening it up in unity!
feel free to make any pull requests, though be warned, some of the things you may do i might already have done some of or all of on my side, and i just haven't pushed it yet, so i'd recommend against pull requests for basic features (as i'm almost certainly in the middle of doing them)
## other info
coming soon :)
## plans
- get parity with osu!trigen v1.5 excluding some areas [such as custom themes or triangle direction]
- save custom triangle sprites as base64 inside config (instead of just a path)
- add MP3 & WAV support (instead of just WAV)
triangle direction will definitely come back in the future, just not that important to me[hubz] right now
