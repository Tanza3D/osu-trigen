# osu!trigen [REWRITE]
## development info
we're currently developing the rewrite on 2022.1.0b1. to build, it should be as easy as cloning the repo and opening it up in unity!
feel free to make any pull requests, though be warned, some of the things you may do i might already have done some of or all of on my side, and i just haven't pushed it yet, so i'd recommend against pull requests for basic features (as i'm almost certainly in the middle of doing them)
## other info
coming soon :)
